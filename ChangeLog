	* registryd/registry.c : separated event listeners to use
	3 separate lists (focus, window, toolkit).  Began testing
	event names against hashes before relaying events.
	* test/at.c : now register for events of type "focus:"
	* test/app.c : now generate events of type "focus:"
	* at-bridge/bridge.c : register with ATK for focus events,
	and we now relay those focus events to any "focus:" listeners.
	This now works with the bridge as a GTK_MODULE when running test/at.
	* libspi/registry.c :
	* libspi/listener.c : now we ref event sources before propagating, and unref on receipt.
	* libspi/registry.c : some changes to internal structs, to support event typestring hashes.
	* text/app.c : changed the way the appname is generated.
	
	KNOWN PROBLEMS:
	poll() fails after a few event notifications, when the number of file descriptors
	gets too large.  Investigating.

	* at-bridge/Makefile.am: link against
	../libspi/libspi.la instead of -lspi.

	* at-spi/test/app.c: include 
	bonobo-activation.h. Use a default appname
	if one is not provided.

	* idl/Registry.idl : temporarily changed register_Application
	to oneway, to work around issue with initial registration 
	re-entrancy.
	* idl/Application.idl : changed attribute "id" from readonly 
	to read-write, since it needs to be assigned by Registry.
	* registryd/registryd.c : added call to set application id 
	on registration.
	* registryd/registry.c : changed de-registration procedure to
	use CORBA_Object_hash() to find matching object ref in application
	lists and listener lists.
	* registryd/registry.c : defined EventTypeStruct and EventTypeMajor,
	began distinguishing between event types (work in progress).

2001-08-13  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	CHANGES:
	* libspi/application.c:
	Added implementations for get/set id, get_toolkitName,
	get_version.
	* registryd/registryd.c :
	* test/at.c :
	* test/app.c :
	* Makefile.am :
	Converted from use of OAF to bonobo-activation.
	* libspi/desktop.h :
	* libspi/desktop.c :
	* test/app.c :
	Removed references to atksimpleobject, since base atkobject
	implementation now provides functionality we need.
	* libspi/atksimpleobject.c :
	* libspi/atksimpleobject.h :
	Removed.
	
	ADDITIONS:
	* at-bridge
	* at-bridge/Makefile.am
	* at-bridge/bridge.c
	* configure.in
	* Makefile.am
	Added directory "bridge" and contents, and added dependencies
	in Makefile.am/configure.in.  
	Initial checkin of "at-bridge".
	This code is a GTK_MODULE which automatically registers
	GTK+ apps with the accessibility registry, using an object
	reference to the root ATK object.
	
2001-08-10  Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

	* po/Makefile.in.in: Remove. Again. If this
	doesn't get autogenerated - you need to update
	gnome-common.

2001-08-07  Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

	* po/Makefile.in.in: Add. Again.

2001-07-31  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

        * libspi/accessible.c : added support for 'description' property.
	* libspi/accessible.c
	* libspi/desktop.c
	* libspi/registry.c : changed to use bonobo_object instead of bonobo_x_object
	    (since the two are now equivalent in libbonobo)
	* idl/Action.idl
	* idl/Component.idl
	* idl/Hyperlink.idl
	* idl/Image.idl
	* idl/Selection.idl
	* idl/Table.idl
	* idl/Text.idl
	* idl/Value.idl : changed these 'secondary' interfaces to inherit from
	     Bonobo::Unknown as does Accessibility::Accessible.
	* idl/StreamableContent.idl : as above, and replaced internal InputStream
	     interface with Bonobo::Stream, since it was redundant with it.
	     (The Stream returned by a StreamableContext object is expected to
	     implement only a subset of Bonobo::Stream)

2001-07-28  Anders Carlsson  <andersca@gnome.org>

        * libspi/accessible.c (accessible_object_finalize): Change
          g_free to g_object_unref since the AtkObject is a GObject.

2001-07-30  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* idl/Accessibility.idl: add new IDL files
	
	Added:
	* idl/Action.idl: Definitions of actionable UI object
	* idl/Component.idl: Definitions of UI component geometry, etc.
	* idl/Hyperlink.idl: Defs of hyperlink behavior
	* idl/Image.idl: Def of accessible image
	* idl/Selection.idl: Definition of UI object with selectable children
	* idl/StreamableContent.idl: Definition of UI object with streamable backing data
	* idl/Table.idl: Definitions for access to table ('spreadsheet') elements
	* idl/Text.idl: Interface defs for UI elements with complex textual content
	* idl/Value.idl: Definition of UI element that is a value controller or display
	
2001-07-27  Michael Meeks  <michael@ximian.com>

	* po/Makefile.in.in: remove autogenerated file from CVS.

	* libspi/Makefile.am: Radicaly re-vamp to simplify & add ORBit2
	type library.

	* idl/Registry.idl: include guard.

	files.

	redundant at_.

2001-07-27  Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

	  test/.cvsignore: updated.

	* initial CVS checkin
