<2001-09-30  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* libspi/accessible.c:
		Stubbed-in the implementations for
			Accessibility_Accessible_getState and
			Accessibility_Accessible_getRelationSet.
	* libspi/registry.c:
		Improved de-registration process and fixed some bugs, 
			deregistration should work correctly
			once the compare_object_func()'s CORBA_Object_hash
			usage is fixed (currently still broken).
		(Probably the event listener registration still needs
			fixing.)
	* libspi/desktop.c:
		Added initialization of applications list (to NULL).
	* util/magnifier.c:
		Reduced speech compression from 0.5 to 0.7, for demo.
		Changed call to gdk_window_set_decorations()
			to gtk_window_set_decorated().
	* at-bridge/bridge.c:
		Bridge now deregisters when app exits, via
			registration of a cleanup function
			with the g_atexit() call.
			Required making 'app' static, renamed 'this_app'.
		Fixed broken use of bonobo_init, passing argv wrongly.

<2001-09-27  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

		If env variable MAGNIFIER is set, a magnifier service
			will be started if one does not exist.
	
<2001-09-25  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>
	* at-bridge/bridge.c:
		applied patch from Marc to build and run 
	        against new glib and gtk+ (seemed like a change 
	        to bonobo_init signature was made ?)
	* test/simple-at.c:
		made festival-server support turned off by default.
		Added support for a simple magnifier (off by default)

2001-08-24  Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

	* libspi/listener.c(impl_notify_event):
	BonoboUnkown_unref the source instead
	of bonobo_object_release_unref - the ORB
	handles the releasing.

	* configure.in: require ORBit-2.3.94 for
	this behaviour.

2001-08-21  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

        Tagged CVS repository 'EA_1_0'.
        * README.EARLY_ACCESS:

        added someone.
        Listed some known dependencies of at-spi.

2001-08-20  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* docs/at-spi-docs.sgml:
	* docs/at-spi-sections.txt:
	* docs/at-spi-overrides.txt: (Added zero-length file)
	Documentation improvements - gtk-doc should build
	docs for all implemented C bindings now.
	* cspi/Makefile.am:

	* cspi/spi_application.c: (New file)
	* cspi/spi_component.c: (New file)
	Split spi_main.c into six parts, and included them from
	"spi.c".  This is a bit of a hack, probably temporary,
	but required by gtk-doc, apparently.
	
2001-08-20  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* docs/Makefile.am:
	* docs/at-spi-docs.sgml:
	* docs/at-spi-sections.txt:
	* configure.in:

2001-08-19  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* cspi/spi.h:
	* cspi/spi.c:
	Made method naming consistent: methods taking object args
	start with uppercase, other methods (except those using
	acronyms) start with lowercase.  Underscores delimit between
	object names and method names:
	SPI_init() - uppercase since it starts with an acronym.
	getDesktopCount () - lowercase start since no object param0.
	Accessible_getName() - uppercase object type name, studlyCaps method
	                       name.

	*cspi/spi.h:
	Added gtk-doc documentation for all currently implemented
	methods in the C bindings API.

2001-08-18  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* Makefile.am : changed build order to build test last.
	* cspi/spi.h :
	* cspi/spi_main.c :

	Bugfix for addition of callbacks.
	* test/Makefile.am :
	* test/simple-at.c :
	Added new test that uses the C bindings API.
	* idl/Event.idl :
	* libspi/listener.c :
	* libspi/registry.c :
	* libspi/accessibleeventlistener.c :
	* at-bridge/bridge.c :
	Renamed member "target" of Accessibility_Event to "source",
	which is more descriptive.
	

2001-08-18  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* Makefile.am: 
	* configure.in :
	* cspi/Makefile.am :
	Added makefile support for at-spi/cspi directory.
	* cspi/spi.h : 
	* cspi/spi-impl.h :
	* cspi/spi-listener.h : (NEW FILE)
	Added support for/use of spi-listener.h.
	* cspi/spi_main.c :
	C bindings now build successfully, with no warnings.
	* libspi/accessibleeventlistener.h : (NEW FILE)
	* libspi/accessibleeventlistener.c : (NEW FILE)
	* libspi/Makefile.am :
	Added new object type "AccessibleEventListener"
	which inherits from Listener, and allows attachment
	of in-process callbacks (so that a client with a listening
	object instance can add functionality to the local 
	implementation, dynamically).

2001-08-18  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* libspi/accessible.c: 
	Add implementation for get_index_in_parent().
	* cspi/spi.h : 
	Added #include of "spi-roletypes.h", and
	added enumerated type AccessibleCoordType.
	Added definition for KeystrokeListener (function type).

	ADDED FILES:
	* cspi/spi-statetypes.h :
	* cspi/spi-roletypes.h :
	* cspi/spi-impl.h :
	Added these headers, used by spi.h.
	* cspi/spi_main.c : 
	Added code (NOTE: not yet built by make).

2001-08-18  Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

	* libspi/Makefile.am: generate imodule
	at the same time as other idl compiler 
	generated files. 

2001-08-17  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>
	* libspi/registry.c :
	* libspi/application.c :
	* idl/Application.idl :
	Made registration with toolkit an application method,
	which is required since each app has its own toolkit static
	environment.  Thus the bridge must register for 
	notification of toolkit events from each application in turn.
	Toolkit notifications are now successfully registered for, and
	sent to the listening at client.
	* test/at.c :
	Changed toolkit event string to use hyphens rather than underscores.
	* libspi/listener.c :
	listner now gives more info in debug mode - it reports the
	name of the event received, as well as the name of the source.
	

2001-08-16  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* libspi/registry.c :
	added more implementation for toolkit events.
	Fixed bug such that toolkit event registrations
	(via atk) use the whole event name string, not 
	just minor+detail.
	Removed a useless call to an ORBit_ method.
	* at-bridge/bridge.c :
	Removed unused local sbuf[] variable.
	* test/at.c :
	We now register for Gtk:GtkWidget:button_press_event 
	events as well as "focus:" events.
	* cspi/spi.h :
	Add some more API from Registry.idl that was missing,
	for keystroke listening, keystroke and mouse event
	synthesis, and enumeration of accessible desktops.

2001-08-16  Michael Meeks  <michael@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: use AM_GLIB_GNU_GETTEXT.

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): kill intl.

2001-08-15  Michael Meeks  <michael@ximian.com>

	* registryd/Makefile.am: s/oaf/server/ relocate info file.

	* configure.in: upd.

	* configure.in: depend on a recent bonobo-activation that
	will find our server files ...

2001-08-16  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* libspi/accessible.c : accessible_new() :
	Now we add the Component interface via bonobo_object_add_interface,
	if the contained AtkObject implements AtkComponent.
	* libspi/accessible.h : now include "component.h"
	* libspi/component.h :
	* libspi/component.c : added files - implementation of
	bonobo wrapper object for Accessibility/Component
	* libspi/listener.c :
	Added test code to check for Accessibility/Component:1.0
	interface and report whether it is implemented by the
	event source.
	* libspi/registry.c :
	Now we check for not only the hash of the whole event 
	string before relaying the event, we also check the
	"minor" event string (without the detail string).
	This allows event listeners to be registered against
	all events of a certain major+minor type, or just
	against a specific major+minor+detail type.
	* libspi/accessible.c :
	Added implementations for Accessible:get_parent(),
	Accessible:getChildCount(), and Accessible:getChildAtIndex().
	* libspi/registry.c :
	* libspi/listener.c :
	Replaced calls to Accessibility_Accessible_ref() and
	Accessibility_Accessible_unref() with 
	calls to bonobo_object_dup_ref() and 
	bonobo_object_release_unref(), so that the CORBA object
	is dup-ed and released when relayed, as well as the bonobo object.

2001-08-15  Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

	* libspi/Makefile.am,
          registryd/Makefile.am,
          at-bridge/Makefile.am.
          test/Makefile.am, configure.in:
	reverse previous changes.

	* configure.in, libspi/Makefile.am:
	Change IDL path checking for bonobo-activation
	as opposed to oaf.

2001-08-15  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* registryd/registry.c : separated event listeners to use
	3 separate lists (focus, window, toolkit).  Began testing
	event names against hashes before relaying events.
	* test/at.c : now register for events of type "focus:"
	* test/app.c : now generate events of type "focus:"
	* at-bridge/bridge.c : register with ATK for focus events,
	and we now relay those focus events to any "focus:" listeners.
	This now works with the bridge as a GTK_MODULE when running test/at.
	* libspi/registry.c :
	* libspi/listener.c : 
	now we ref event sources before propagating, and unref on receipt.
	* libspi/registry.c : 
	some changes to internal structs, to support event typestring hashes.
	* text/app.c : changed the way the appname is generated.
	* cspi : added directory that will hold the C bindings library for 
		non-CORBA/bonobo-savvy clients.
	* cspi/spi.h : header file that contains the function prototypes for the C binding.
	* idl/Component.idl : added in parameter to indicate coord system for
		geometry-related calls.
	* idl/Hyperlink.idl : added readonly n_links attribute
	* idl/Image.idl : changed methods to attributes.
	
2001-08-15  Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

	* at-bridge/Makefile.am: link against
	../libspi/libspi.la instead of -lspi.

	* at-spi/test/app.c: include 
	bonobo-activation.h. Use a default appname
	if one is not provided.

2001-08-14  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* idl/Registry.idl : temporarily changed register_Application
	to oneway, to work around issue with initial registration 
	re-entrancy.
	* idl/Application.idl : changed attribute "id" from readonly 
	to read-write, since it needs to be assigned by Registry.
	* registryd/registryd.c : added call to set application id 
	on registration.
	* registryd/registry.c : changed de-registration procedure to
	use CORBA_Object_hash() to find matching object ref in application
	lists and listener lists.
	* registryd/registry.c : defined EventTypeStruct and EventTypeMajor,
	began distinguishing between event types (work in progress).

2001-08-13  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	CHANGES:
	* libspi/application.c:

	Removed.
	
	ADDITIONS:
	* at-bridge

	reference to the root ATK object.
	
2001-08-10  Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

	* po/Makefile.in.in: Remove. Again. If this
	doesn't get autogenerated - you need to update

	* po/Makefile.in.in: Add. Again.

2001-07-31  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

        * libspi/accessible.c : added support for 'description' property.
	* libspi/accessible.c
	* libspi/desktop.c
	* libspi/registry.c : changed to use bonobo_object instead of bonobo_x_object
	    (since the two are now equivalent in libbonobo)
	* idl/Action.idl
	* idl/Component.idl
	* idl/Hyperlink.idl
	* idl/Image.idl
	* idl/Selection.idl
	* idl/Table.idl
	* idl/Text.idl
	* idl/Value.idl : changed these 'secondary' interfaces to inherit from
	     Bonobo::Unknown as does Accessibility::Accessible.
	* idl/StreamableContent.idl : as above, and replaced internal InputStream
	     interface with Bonobo::Stream, since it was redundant with it.
	     (The Stream returned by a StreamableContext object is expected to
	     implement only a subset of Bonobo::Stream)

        * libspi/accessible.c (accessible_object_finalize): Change
          g_free to g_object_unref since the AtkObject is a GObject.
