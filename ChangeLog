2001-11-23  Michael Meeks  <michael@ximian.com>

	* cspi/spi_event.c (AccessibleEventListener_removeCallback):
	comment out non existant method invoke so we link.

	* cspi/spi-util.c (spi_warn_ev): conform to gtk+ style,
	use bonobo_exception_get_text for more friendly warnings.

	* cspi/spi.c (Obj_Add): move into spi_main & rename
	spi_object_add; kill spi.c

	* cspi/spi_registry.c
	(deregisterGlobalEventListener),
	(deregisterGlobalEventListenerAll),
	(registerGlobalEventListener): fix exception leaks.

	* cspi/spi_main.c (spi_exception): impl. helper, so we
	don't leak exceptions.

	* cspi/spi_selection.c
	(AccessibleSelection_deselectSelectedChild): return the
	success state.

	* cspi/spi_main.c (spi_ev): impl; hack - gack.
	(spi_registry): ditto.
	(SPI_init): guard against double inits.

	* cspi/*.c: use spi_ev (), and spi_registry () where
	appropriate - a temporary hack until we have something
	better. Use spi_object_add

2001-11-22  Michael Meeks  <michael@ximian.com>

	* cspi/Makefile.am: re organise, install the headers.

	* cspi/*.h: add G_BEGIN/END_DECLS

2001-22-11  Bill Haneman  <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* test/simple-at.c:
	Added non-preemptive keylistener for key events with no modifiers
	and shift-only modifier.

	* libspi/keystrokelistener.c:
	Removed some verbose diagnostics printout.

	* cspi/spi_registry.c:
	Fixed a bug that caused all key listeners to be registered as
	pre-emptive.
	
	* libspi/deviceeventcontroller.c:
	Fixed bug that caused XGrabKey (preemptive key grab) to be called
	for non-preemptive key masks.

	* docs/reference/idl/at-spi-idl-docs.sgml:
	* docs/reference/idl/at-spi-idl-sections.txt:
	* docs/reference/idl/at-spi-idl-overrides.txt:
	Added missing files.

	* docs/reference/Makefile.am:
	removed idl from SUBDIRS until we can figure a way to get gtk-doc
	to scan the IDL files :-(

	* docs/reference:
	* docs/cspi:
	* docs/idl:
	Added .cvsignore files.
	
2001-21-11  Bill Haneman  <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* libspi/deviceeventcontroller.c:
	* libspi/keystrokelistener.c:
	* cspi/spi_event.c:
	* cspi/spi_registry.c:
	Added filters for KeySets, KeyEventSeq, and event types to key
	event dispatching, so listeners should only receive those events
	that they requested :-)

	Restructured docs directory to allow separate 'reference' docs
	section, and forked idl and cspi docs.  Added the sgml template
	files to CVS.  Added the first sections/structural sgml for the
	IDL docs.

2001-11-21  Laszlo Peter  <laca@ireland.sun.com>

	* configure.in, libspi/Makefile.am: find libXtst.

2001-11-21  Michael Meeks  <michael@ximian.com>

	* test/accessx-gui.c: s/spi_value/value/ - doh.

	* libspi/base.[ch]: add.

2001-18-11  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* idl/Accessible.idl:
	* idl/Application.idl:
	* idl/Registry.idl:
	* idl/Action.idl:
	Started gtk-doc cleanup on IDL.

	* libspi/deviceeventcontroller.c:
	Added and connected non-preemptive key notification from the
	toolkits (in addition to the pre-emptive support from XServer
	which we had before, but which causes 'focus flashing').  Filters
	are presently limited to key modifiers and global/non-global,
	KeySets are presently ignored, as are KeyEvent masks.

	Fixed naughtiness in dec_key_listener_new(), we copy the CORBA
	structs into the persistant structure rather than just storing
	pointers to things that might not persist across servant
	invocations.

	The XGrabKey call now does async keygrabs, because synchronous
	ones were deadlocking with GDK_event code in a very nasty way.

	Added boolean to internal method notify_keylisteners, to indicate
	whether the event came from the 'toolkit source' or the 'global
	(XServer) source' - this is used in the notification process to
	determine which listeners to send the event to.

	deviceeventcontroller.c is now warning-free.
	
	* libspi/registry.c:
	Fixed regression in application de-registration.
	Also fixed some really brain-dead weirdness having to do with
	event dispatching - event structs are now duplicated before being
	re-marshalled in the dispatch to listeners.  This also fixes a
	Solaris build problem.
	
	
2001-20-11  Michael Meeks  <michael@ximian.com>

	* libspi/registry.c
	(impl_accessibility_registry_deregister_global_event_listener): 
	segv. protection.

	* libspi/deviceeventcontroller.c
	(spi_device_event_controller_check_key_event): return
	FALSE on no virtual method.

	* libspi/*..h: make includes work on a correctly pathed install.

	* libspi/*.h: include glib/gmacros.h, use G_BEGIN / END _DECLS.

	* libspi/application.h: kill unused ( and whacked out )
	gboolean *spi_application_set_id (AtkObject *app, long id);

2001-20-11  Michael Meeks  <michael@ximian.com>

	* libspi/*.[ch]: further convert to bonobo's type func
	macros, remove redundnant casts etc.

	* libspi/text.c s/accessibility_text/spi_text/g,
	re-order to de-cruft.

	* libspi/hypertext.c: re-order to kill a huge slew
	of redundant forward decls.

	* libspi/relation.c: ditto.

	(spi_keystroke_listener_class_init),
	(spi_keystroke_listener_init): rename to this.

	* libspi/text.c (impl_getAttributes): fix warning / bug.

	* libspi/*.[ch]: more headers, includes and over commenting.
	
2001-20-11  Michael Meeks  <michael@ximian.com>

	* libspi/*.[ch]: fixup headers, includes and over commenting.

	* libspi/image.c (impl__get_imageDescription): const
	correctness warning fix. remove redundant casting.

	* libspi/table.c (impl_getRowDescription): ditto.
	(impl_getColumnDescription): ditto.

	* libspi/component.c (accessibility_component_get_type): 
	rename to (spi_component_get_type): and macroify.
	(accessibility_component_init): rename to

	(accessibility_component_class_init): rename to
	(spi_component_class_init): this

	* libspi/action.c (spi_action_get_type): kill, use the macro.

	* libspi/deviceeventcontroller.c (_compare_listeners): re-order
	to avoid prototype.

	* libspi/application.c (spi_application_object_event_listener),
	(impl_accessibility_application_register_object_event_listener):
	warning fixes / const understanding updates.

	* libspi/accessible.c (impl_accessibility_accessible_get_relation_set):
	warning fixes.

2001-18-11  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* libspi/spi_accessible.c: Added docs and C bindings for
	AccessibleStateSet. (No implementations yet).  Documentation
	coverage for C bindings now 100%. Made docs for event listeners
	more explicit.
	
	* idl/Registry.idl:
	Added methods 
            boolean notifyListenersSync (in DeviceEventListener listener,
				     in DeviceEvent event);

            oneway void notifyListenersAsync (in DeviceEventListener listener,
					  in DeviceEvent event);

	Added DeviceEventListener and DeviceEvent structs (may deprecate
	KeyStroke and KeystrokeListener in favor of this generic
	event/listener framework for devices).

	* libspi/deviceeventcontroller.c:

	Changed some key listener code to take masks, etc., and paved the
	way for integration of toolkit/non-preemptive key events. Changed
	signatures of some internal methods.

	* at-bridge/bridge.c:
        Fixed regression connecting to interface signals, apparently
	caused by GTK+ changes.

	Added an internal bridge_state_listener to deal with
	property-change:accessible-state signals.

	Changed the key_listeners GList to store structs (including masks,
	etc.) instead of just CORBA_Objects (required for full
	implementation of key listener API).

	Connected the bridge to all currently supported Atk signals.
	Events now supported: 
	    object:property-change
            object:property-change:accessible-name
            object:property-change:accessible-state
            object:property-change:accessible-description

            object:column-reordered
            object:column-deleted
            object:model-changed        

2001-16-11  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* libspi/hyperlink.c,h:
	Fixed some broken stuff in hyperlink.
	
	* libspi/relation.h:
	* libspi/relation.c:
	* cspi/spi_accessible.c:
	Initial implementations of AccessibleRelation methods, and docs.

	* libspi/accessible.c:
	Fixed a bug that caused SEGV  if an accessible
	object's description is NULL, and a client
	requests it.  An empty string is now returned.

	* cspi/spi_editabletext.c:
	* cspi/spi_hypertext.c:
	* cspi/spi_image.c:
	* cspi/spi_hyperlink.c:
	* cspi/spi_table.c:
	Added docs.  

	Doc coverage now 95%.

2001-16-11  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	One last namespacing revision:
	* libspi/accessibleeventlistener.[ch]:
	Renamed SpiAccessibleEventListener to SpiEventListener,
	(no need for two namespaces ;-)

	And lots of documentation fixes:

	* docs/at-spi-docs.sgml:
	Fixed 'underscore vs. hyphen' bug that was preventing
	the gtk-doc API docs from being automatically generated.

	* cspi/spi-impl.h

2001-14-11  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* at-bridge/bridge.c:
	Initial work for toolkit-level key snooper connection by bridge.

	* cspi/spi-impl.h:
	* cspi/spi_*.h:
	* cspi/spi_*.c:
	New typedefs and fixes to support new namespacing, and cleaner
	separation of cspi bindings from libspi bonobo implementation.	
	Removed inconsistent and extraneous Spi* namespace prefix that
	had crept into cspi headers.
	Lots of comment fixes that sed had missed.

	* cspi/spi-roletypes.h:
	* cspi/spi-statetypes.h:
	Added SPI_ prefix to Role and State typedefs, and changed all-caps ROLE type
	to AccessibleRoleType.
	
	* libspi/accessibleeventlistener.h:
	Fixed minor namespacing weirdness.

	* libspi/deviceeventcontroller.c:
        Reordered some internal API for device listeners.
	Changed the key registry final boolean to 'is_system_global'
	rather than 'is_synchronous', which is more descriptive of its 
	actual meaning.
	Added spi_device_event_controller_new().
	Added  SpiRegistry backpointer to SpiDeviceEventControllerClass.
	 
	* libspi/keystrokelistener.[ch]:
	Namespaced KeystrokeListener to SpiKeystrokeListener.
	Changed uses of keymasks to use SPI_ prefix, and did other
	knock-on fixups.

	* libspi/keymasks.h:
	Namespaced keymask constants with SPI_ prefix.

	* libspi/registry.c:
	Some warning fixes, and knock-on fixes from namespace changes.

	* test/Makefile.am:
	Added rules for accessx-gui test program.

	* test/accessx-gui.c:
	Added a simple GUI program in GTK+-2.0 for the AccessX keyboard
	utility.  It doesn't actually use at-spi, but it's still cool and
	useful ;-)

	* test/keysynth-demo.c:
	* test/simple-at.c:
	* test/at.c:
	* test/app.c:
	Fixes so that these test clients work properly with the namespaced
	libraries. (Incompletely tested for technical reasons, fixes may follow)
	

2001-13-11  Michael Meeks  <michael@ximian.com>

	* libspi/application.c
	(impl_accessibility_application_get_version),
	(impl_accessibility_application_get_toolkit_name):
	warning fixes.
	(impl_accessibility_application_set_id),
	(impl_accessibility_application_get_id): remove
	redundant casting code.

	* libspi/action.c (impl_getDescription): fix warnings.

	* libspi/accessible.c
	(impl_accessibility_accessible_get_parent),
	(impl_accessibility_accessible_get_child_at_index),
	(impl_accessibility_accessible_get_state),
	(impl_accessibility_accessible_get_relation_set):
	warning fixes & include action.h

2001-13-11  Michael Meeks  <michael@ximian.com>

	* *.[ch] fix bits I screwed up:

		s/([^ \tb(\*\&\?\",])spi_/\1/g;
		s/([^ \tb(\*\&\?\",])Spi/\1/g;
	
2001-13-11  Michael Meeks  <michael@ximian.com>

	* *.[ch] Namespace libspi into spi_ and Spi.

2001-13-11  Michael Meeks  <michael@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: dist & install at-spi-1.0.pc

	* libspi/Makefile.am: install into at-spi-1.0

	* idl/Makefile.am (idldir): install into at-spi-1.0

	* at-spi-1.0.pc.in: add.

	* configure.in: build it.

2001-12-11  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

        * test/keysynth-demo.c:
        Use a 'realize' signal-handler to set the WM properties for
        the virtual keyboard, rather than making it a "POPUP" type
        override-redirect window (thanks to anders carlsson for that
        tip!)

2001-11-11  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* test/Makefile.am:
	* test/keysynth-demo.c:
	Added new test of key synthesis, which creates a simple
	(mouse-operated) onscreen keyboard.  It inserts key events into
	the currently-focused window, thus it does not grab keyboard focus
	itself.

	* cspi/spi_registry.c:
	Added C binding for AT-SPI generateKeyEvent.

	* libspi/deviceeventcontroller.c:
	Added call to XFilterEvent so that key listener works with XIM (we
	hope).  Added event_synth_type to generateKeyEvent, so that we can
	produce KEY_PRESS, KEY_RELEASE, KEY_PRESSRELEASE (pair), or
	synthesize a press/release pair for KeySyms.	
	
2001-11-09  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* libspi/Makefile.am: 
	* registryd/Makefile.am:
	(temporary) hack to include libXtst in libspi and registryd.
	(Needed for keystroke synthesis, see below).

	* idl/Registry.idl:
	Improved API for registerKeystrokeListener, in accordance with
	discussions with Gnopernicus team and X server research.

	* libspi/registry.c:
	* libspi/deviceeventcontroller.c:
	* libspi/accessible.c:
	* libspi/keystrokelistener.c:
	Changes and fixes to support keylisteners for potentially
	consumed key events (that is, 'passive grabs').
	Added implementation for generateKeyEvent() [untested].

	* cspi/spi.h:
	Changes to registerKeystrokeListener() API, as above.
	Added deregisterGlobalEventListenerAll(), and 
	deregisterKeystrokeListener(), which are needed for clean exit of
	clients.
	Added typedefs for KeyListenerSyncType, KeyEventMask, and KeySet,
	and a macro ALL_KEYS which may be used in place of a KeySet pointer.
	
	* cspi/spi_registry.c:
	Added implementations of function prototypes mentioned above.
	
	* registryd/registryd.c:
	Added the key listener event source as a g_timeout(), to allow
	receipt of key events that are not caught by GDK (since GDK
	doesn't support passive keygrabs, this was necessary).

	* test/simple-at.c:
	Changed to attach a keylistener to 'Alt' keys, and
	respond to the following keycommands: Alt-M (toggle magnifier);
	Alt-F (toggle speech); Alt-Q (quit).
	Added an exit routine to deregister the listeners, and a key
	listener that prints some key info to the console when a key
	matches the listener mask (and is thus received by the listener).
	
	* util/idl/Magnifier.idl:
	Changes to magnifier API to support multiple zoom regions,
	non-uniform scaling in x and y, markDirty, and a host of other
	features that would be useful to magnification.

	* util/mag_image.h:
	* util/mag_client.c:
	* util/mag_client.h:
	* util/mag_control.c:
	* util/magnifier.c:
	Source code changes to support the above IDL changes.
	
	* util/mag_image.c:
	As above, and also changes to use a (slower) generic conversion
	path for colormap conversions, since the fast RGB conversions have been
	reported to fail for 16-bit displays.

2001-10-26  Michael Meeks  <michael@ximian.com>

	* libspi/Makefile.am (orbittypelibdir): install in orbit-2.0

<2001-10-26  Laszlo Peter <laca@ireland.sun.com>

	* at-bridge/Makefile.am: fix LDFLAGS.

<2001-10-09  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* at-bridge/bridge.c:
	Re-worked listeners for toolkit events, now we have signal
	and property listeners. Added a private method
	register_atk_event_listeners(), which registers with the
	various atk and gtk signals we need to monitor in order to emit
	our at-spi events.
	Added emission hook for AtkObject:property-change events, to
	support the 'property listeners'.
	Fixed some alloc()s of Accessibility_Event structs to use CORBA
	allocation.

	* cspi/spi-util.c: added methods spi_warn_ev and spi_check_ev,
	which emit warnings and exit, respectively, if CORBA errors occur
	during remote calls, and we now use these methods to check most of
	our CORBA calls in the C bindings.

	* cspi/spi_accessible.c:
	Changed AccessibleSelection_refSelectedChild() to
	AccessibleSelection_getSelectedChild(), since all our cspi 'gets'
	now increment refcounts.

	* cspi/spi_component.c:
	Fixed some long pointer casts (dangerous!) to pass pointers to
	CORBA_longs of the proper type to the CORBA stubs, and copy the
	data into the longs that were passed into the C bindings code.
	
	* at-bridge/bridge.c:
	
	* libspi/accessible.c:
	Removed ATK_IS_HYPERLINK() query, since AtkObjects are never
	hyperlinks, AtkHyperlink is an object type.	

	* libspi/application.c:
	Added various conversions to and from "generic" event types and
	atk-specific types; this is really part of the 'bridge'
	implementation but is valid for all AtkObject-based accessibility 
	implementations.

	* libspi/editabletext.c:
	Fixed nasty bug wherein editable text's finalize method was
	unref'ing tha AtkObject reference that the text parent class was
	about to unref _again_.  There was also a nasty inheritance bug
	that meant that the AccessibleEditableText class was corrupt.

	* libspi/selection.c:
	Provided implementations for some selection API that was broken.
	
	* idl/Application.idl:
	Added registerObjectEventListener () method.

	* THROUGHOUT:
	Fixed a number of return values that were Bonobo_Unknowns from
	bonobo_object_corba_objref(), which I
	forgot to dup before returning.  Changed instances of 
	bonobo_object_corba_objref (bonobo_object(o)) to
	BONOBO_OBJREF(o), for concision and clarity.
	
<2001-10-13  Louise Miller <louise.miller@sun.com>

	* idl/Accessible.idl, idl/Application.idl, idl/Desktop.idl,
	idl/Event.idl, idl/Registry.idl
	Changed these files to include Bonobo_Unknown.idl instead
	of Bonobo.idl

<2001-09-10  Marc Mulcahy <marc.mulcahy@sun.com

	* libspi/component.c libspi/component.h:
		Fixed typo.  Added assertions for object checks in 
	AccessibleComponent code.

<2001-10-09  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* idl/Accessible.idl:
		Added 'isEqual (Accessible *object)' 
	method for Accessible. (Not Yet Implemented).
	
	* idl/Registry.idl:
		Changed signature of registerKeystrokeListener() to
	take a KeySet and KeyEventSeq so that specific keys and event
	types could be requested for monitoring, and added a flag
	is_synchronous so that either synchronous or asynchronous
	notification could be requested.  (However this is not all
	implemented yet). This also meant adding two new typedefs,
	KeyEventSeq and KeySet.

	* idl/Relation.idl: 
		Added two new relations, RELATION_TOOLTIP_FOR and
	RELATION_LEAFNODE_OF.

	* idl/State.idl:
		Added new state, STATE_HAS_TOOLTIP.
	
	* libspi/text.c, editabletext.c:
		Added new assertions to all casts of bonobo-objects from
	CORBA servants, to prevent Text API calls on non-text objects.
		Changed suspect casts of int-pointer types, so that we
	always send a valid CORBA_long pointer to the CORBA APIs that use
	in/out long parameters.  We then have to copy from the CORBA_long
	into the regular long or int for return to the C bindings, or
	vice-versa when returning parameters from ATK calls to the bonobo wrappers.
	
	* cspi/spi_text.c:
	* libspi/deviceeventcontroller.c:
		Cleaned these sources up.
	* idl/Text.idl:
		Changed return type for getCharacterAtOffset to
	CORBA_unsigned_long, to allow for 32-bit characters.
	
		
<2001-10-08  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* util/Makefile.am:
	* idl/Makefile.am:
		Fixed 'make dist' so that distro compiles...
	* libspi/keymasks.h:
		new file.
	* cspi/spi-listener.c:
		KeystrokeListenerCB now returns a boolean.
	* cspi/spi.h:
		Added KeyEventType struct, and KeyStroke.
		Also added createKeystrokeListener(),
	KeystrokeListener_addCallback(),
	KeystrokeListener_removeCallback(), and added a keymask to
	registerKeystrokeListener().
	* cspi/spi_accessible.c:
		Changed numerous return types for interfaces from
	AccessibleComponent to Accessible<InterfaceName>; this was
	probably a cut-and-paste error.
	* cspi/spi_event.c:
		Implementations of new KeystrokeListener api (from spi.h,
	above).
	* idl/Registry.idl:
		Changes to key modifier mapping.
		Created ControllerEventMask struct.
		Made DeviceEventController derive from Bonobo::Unknown.
	* idl/Text.idl:
		Removed TEXT_BOUNDARY_CURSOR_POS boundary type.
	* libspi/deviceeventcontroller.c:
		Added a number of new internal (private) methods.
	* libspi/editabletext.c:
	* libspi/editabletext.h:
		Fixed a number of bugs related to the fact that
	editabletext inherits from text.  Fixed the EditableText struct,
	the init() call, and use correct casts when calling Text methods
	from an EditableText object.  Removed (duplicate) atko from the
	EditableText structure, we use the one in the parent Text
	structure via the casts mentioned above.
	* libspi/keystrokelistener.[ch]:
	* libspi/registry.c:
		Changes in support of keyboard handling (above).
	
	Keyboard handling, though partly functional, is still not
	recommended for at-spi client use as there is considerable 
	work yet to be done.

	* libspi/text.c:
		Changed some places where pointers to various int types
	are cast to be pointers to CORBA_long types and vice-versa:
	pointer casting is not safe so we pass pointers of the correct
	types and then cast the result before putting it into the target
	pointers.

	* libspi/text.h: minor typos corrected.
	* test/simple-at.c: 
		We now speak not only the name of a Text element, but the
	first sentence of its content, when it receives focus.
		I also changed the text compression to 75% from 50%.
	* util/Accessibility_Util.server.in:
		Changed the default magnifier type to be a 3x vertical
	splitscreen magnifier (was previously a 2x horizontal one).

<2001-10-03  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* libspi/keystrokelistener.h:
	* libspi/keystrokelistener.c:

	* libspi/deviceeventcontroller.h:
		Began creating implementations of DeviceEventController,
			to handle keystroke and mouse event listening and
			synthesis.
	* libspi/accessible.c:
		Stubbed-in the implementations for
			Accessibility_Accessible_getState and
			Accessibility_Accessible_getRelationSet.
	* libspi/registry.c:
		Improved de-registration process and fixed some bugs, 
			deregistration now works correctly.
	* libspi/desktop.c:
		Added initialization of applications list (to NULL).
	* util/magnifier.c:
		Reduced speech compression from 0.5 to 0.7, for demo.
		Changed call to gdk_window_set_decorations()
			to gtk_window_set_decorated().
	* at-bridge/bridge.c:
		Bridge now deregisters when app exits, via
			registration of a cleanup function
			with the g_atexit() call.
			Required making 'app' static, renamed 'this_app'.
		Fixed broken use of bonobo_init, passing argv wrongly.

<2001-09-27  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	        Client program example for 
			Magnification service
	
	* util/Accessibility_Magnifier.server.in:

			magnifier that uses socket-listening IPC.

		If env variable MAGNIFIER is set, a magnifier service
			will be started if one does not exist.

	* at-bridge/bridge.c:
		applied patch from Marc to build and run 
	        against new glib and gtk+ (seemed like a change 
	        to bonobo_init signature was made ?)
	* test/simple-at.c:
		made festival-server support turned off by default.
		Added support for a simple magnifier (off by default)
		which will be added to a 'util' directory later.
	* at-bridge/Makefile.am:
		Changed "application.h" header from a 'source'
		to a 'dependency' of libat-bridge.

2001-08-24  Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

	* libspi/listener.c(impl_notify_event):
	BonoboUnkown_unref the source instead
	of bonobo_object_release_unref - the ORB
	handles the releasing.

	* configure.in: require ORBit-2.3.94 for
	this behaviour.

2001-08-21  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

        Tagged CVS repository 'EA_1_0'.

	* cspi/spi_component.c: (New file)
	Split spi_main.c into six parts, and included them from
	"spi.c".  This is a bit of a hack, probably temporary,
	but required by gtk-doc, apparently.
	
2001-08-20  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* docs/Makefile.am:
	* docs/at-spi-docs.sgml:

2001-08-19  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* cspi/spi.h:
	* cspi/spi.c:
	Made method naming consistent: methods taking object args
	start with uppercase, other methods (except those using
	acronyms) start with lowercase.  Underscores delimit between
	object names and method names:
	SPI_init() - uppercase since it starts with an acronym.
	getDesktopCount () - lowercase start since no object param0.
	Accessible_getName() - uppercase object type name, studlyCaps method
	                       name.

	*cspi/spi.h:
	Added gtk-doc documentation for all currently implemented
	methods in the C bindings API.

2001-08-18  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* Makefile.am : changed build order to build test last.
	* cspi/spi.h :

	Added new test that uses the C bindings API.
	* idl/Event.idl :
	* libspi/listener.c :
	* libspi/registry.c :
	* libspi/accessibleeventlistener.c :
	* at-bridge/bridge.c :
	Renamed member "target" of Accessibility_Event to "source",
	which is more descriptive.
	

2001-08-18  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* Makefile.am: 
	* configure.in :
	* cspi/Makefile.am :
	Added makefile support for at-spi/cspi directory.
	* cspi/spi.h : 
	* cspi/spi-impl.h :
	* cspi/spi-listener.h : (NEW FILE)
	Added support for/use of spi-listener.h.
	* cspi/spi_main.c :
	C bindings now build successfully, with no warnings.
	* libspi/accessibleeventlistener.h : (NEW FILE)
	* libspi/accessibleeventlistener.c : (NEW FILE)
	* libspi/Makefile.am :
	Added new object type "AccessibleEventListener"
	which inherits from Listener, and allows attachment
	of in-process callbacks (so that a client with a listening
	object instance can add functionality to the local 
	implementation, dynamically).

2001-08-18  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* libspi/accessible.c: 
	Add implementation for get_index_in_parent().
	* cspi/spi.h : 
	Added #include of "spi-roletypes.h", and
	added enumerated type AccessibleCoordType.
	Added definition for KeystrokeListener (function type).

	ADDED FILES:
	* cspi/spi-statetypes.h :
	* cspi/spi-roletypes.h :
	* cspi/spi-impl.h :
	Added these headers, used by spi.h.
	* cspi/spi_main.c : 
	Added code (NOTE: not yet built by make).

2001-08-18  Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

	* libspi/Makefile.am: generate imodule
	at the same time as other idl compiler 
	generated files. 

2001-08-17  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>
	* libspi/registry.c :
	* libspi/application.c :
	* idl/Application.idl :
	Made registration with toolkit an application method,
	which is required since each app has its own toolkit static
	environment.  Thus the bridge must register for 
	notification of toolkit events from each application in turn.
	Toolkit notifications are now successfully registered for, and
	sent to the listening at client.
	* test/at.c :
	Changed toolkit event string to use hyphens rather than underscores.
	* libspi/listener.c :
	listner now gives more info in debug mode - it reports the
	name of the event received, as well as the name of the source.
	

2001-08-16  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* libspi/registry.c :
	added more implementation for toolkit events.
	Fixed bug such that toolkit event registrations
	(via atk) use the whole event name string, not 
	just minor+detail.
	Removed a useless call to an ORBit_ method.
	* at-bridge/bridge.c :
	Removed unused local sbuf[] variable.
	* test/at.c :
	We now register for Gtk:GtkWidget:button_press_event 
	events as well as "focus:" events.
	* cspi/spi.h :
	Add some more API from Registry.idl that was missing,
	for keystroke listening, keystroke and mouse event
	synthesis, and enumeration of accessible desktops.

2001-08-16  Michael Meeks  <michael@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: use AM_GLIB_GNU_GETTEXT.

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): kill intl.

2001-08-15  Michael Meeks  <michael@ximian.com>

	* registryd/Makefile.am: s/oaf/server/ relocate info file.

	* configure.in: upd.

	* configure.in: depend on a recent bonobo-activation that
	will find our server files ...

2001-08-16  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* libspi/accessible.c : accessible_new() :
	Now we add the Component interface via bonobo_object_add_interface,
	if the contained AtkObject implements AtkComponent.
	* libspi/accessible.h : now include "component.h"
	* libspi/component.h :
	* libspi/component.c : added files - implementation of
	bonobo wrapper object for Accessibility/Component
	* libspi/listener.c :
	Added test code to check for Accessibility/Component:1.0
	interface and report whether it is implemented by the
	event source.
	* libspi/registry.c :
	Now we check for not only the hash of the whole event 
	string before relaying the event, we also check the
	"minor" event string (without the detail string).
	This allows event listeners to be registered against
	all events of a certain major+minor type, or just
	against a specific major+minor+detail type.
	* libspi/accessible.c :
	Added implementations for Accessible:get_parent(),
	Accessible:getChildCount(), and Accessible:getChildAtIndex().
	* libspi/registry.c :
	* libspi/listener.c :
	Replaced calls to Accessibility_Accessible_ref() and
	Accessibility_Accessible_unref() with 
	calls to bonobo_object_dup_ref() and 
	bonobo_object_release_unref(), so that the CORBA object
	is dup-ed and released when relayed, as well as the bonobo object.

2001-08-15  Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

	* libspi/Makefile.am,
          registryd/Makefile.am,
          at-bridge/Makefile.am.
          test/Makefile.am, configure.in:
	reverse previous changes.

	* test/Makefile.am: put DEBUG_FLAGS
	in CFLAGS.

2001-08-15  Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

	g_type_prgname.

2001-08-15  Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

	* libspi/Makefile.am,
	  registryd/Makefile.am,

	AT_COMMON_{LIBS|CFLAGS}.

	* README: format.

2001-08-15  Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>
	
	* configure.in, libspi/Makefile.am:
	Change IDL path checking for bonobo-activation
	as opposed to oaf.

2001-08-15  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* registryd/registry.c : separated event listeners to use
	3 separate lists (focus, window, toolkit).  Began testing
	event names against hashes before relaying events.
	* test/at.c : now register for events of type "focus:"
	* test/app.c : now generate events of type "focus:"
	* at-bridge/bridge.c : register with ATK for focus events,
	and we now relay those focus events to any "focus:" listeners.
	This now works with the bridge as a GTK_MODULE when running test/at.
	* libspi/registry.c :
	* libspi/listener.c : 
	now we ref event sources before propagating, and unref on receipt.
	* libspi/registry.c : 
	some changes to internal structs, to support event typestring hashes.
	* text/app.c : changed the way the appname is generated.
	* cspi : added directory that will hold the C bindings library for 
		non-CORBA/bonobo-savvy clients.
	* cspi/spi.h : header file that contains the function prototypes for the C binding.
	* idl/Component.idl : added in parameter to indicate coord system for
		geometry-related calls.
	* idl/Hyperlink.idl : added readonly n_links attribute
	* idl/Image.idl : changed methods to attributes.
	
2001-08-15  Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

	* at-bridge/Makefile.am: link against
	../libspi/libspi.la instead of -lspi.

	* at-spi/test/app.c: include 
	bonobo-activation.h. Use a default appname
	if one is not provided.

2001-08-14  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* idl/Registry.idl : temporarily changed register_Application
	to oneway, to work around issue with initial registration 
	re-entrancy.
	* idl/Application.idl : changed attribute "id" from readonly 
	to read-write, since it needs to be assigned by Registry.
	* registryd/registryd.c : added call to set application id 
	on registration.
	* registryd/registry.c : changed de-registration procedure to
	use CORBA_Object_hash() to find matching object ref in application
	lists and listener lists.
	* registryd/registry.c : defined EventTypeStruct and EventTypeMajor,
	began distinguishing between event types (work in progress).

2001-08-13  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	CHANGES:
	* libspi/application.c:
	Added implementations for get/set id, get_toolkitName,
	get_version.
	* registryd/registryd.c :
	* test/at.c :
	* test/app.c :
	* Makefile.am :
	Converted from use of OAF to bonobo-activation.
	* libspi/desktop.h :
	* libspi/desktop.c :
	* test/app.c :
	Removed references to atksimpleobject, since base atkobject
	implementation now provides functionality we need.
	* libspi/atksimpleobject.c :
	* libspi/atksimpleobject.h :
	Removed.
	
	ADDITIONS:
	* at-bridge
	* at-bridge/Makefile.am
	* at-bridge/bridge.c
	* configure.in
	* Makefile.am
	Added directory "bridge" and contents, and added dependencies
	in Makefile.am/configure.in.  
	Initial checkin of "at-bridge".
	This code is a GTK_MODULE which automatically registers
	GTK+ apps with the accessibility registry, using an object
	reference to the root ATK object.
	
2001-08-10  Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

	* po/Makefile.in.in: Remove. Again. If this
	doesn't get autogenerated - you need to update
	gnome-common.

2001-08-07  Mark McLoughlin <mark@skynet.ie>

	* po/Makefile.in.in: Add. Again.

2001-07-31  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

        * libspi/accessible.c : added support for 'description' property.
	* libspi/accessible.c
	* libspi/desktop.c
	* libspi/registry.c : changed to use bonobo_object instead of bonobo_x_object
	    (since the two are now equivalent in libbonobo)
	* idl/Action.idl
	* idl/Component.idl
	* idl/Hyperlink.idl
	* idl/Image.idl
	* idl/Selection.idl
	* idl/Table.idl
	* idl/Text.idl
	* idl/Value.idl : changed these 'secondary' interfaces to inherit from
	     Bonobo::Unknown as does Accessibility::Accessible.
	* idl/StreamableContent.idl : as above, and replaced internal InputStream
	     interface with Bonobo::Stream, since it was redundant with it.
	     (The Stream returned by a StreamableContext object is expected to
	     implement only a subset of Bonobo::Stream)

2001-07-28  Anders Carlsson  <andersca@gnome.org>

        * libspi/accessible.c (accessible_object_finalize): Change
          g_free to g_object_unref since the AtkObject is a GObject.

2001-07-30  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

	* idl/Accessibility.idl: add new IDL files
	
	Added:
	* idl/Action.idl: Definitions of actionable UI object
	* idl/Component.idl: Definitions of UI component geometry, etc.
	* idl/Hyperlink.idl: Defs of hyperlink behavior
	* idl/Image.idl: Def of accessible image
	* idl/Selection.idl: Definition of UI object with selectable children
	* idl/StreamableContent.idl: Definition of UI object with streamable backing data
	* idl/Table.idl: Definitions for access to table ('spreadsheet') elements
	* idl/Text.idl: Interface defs for UI elements with complex textual content
	* idl/Value.idl: Definition of UI element that is a value controller or display
