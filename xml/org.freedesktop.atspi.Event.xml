  <tp:member type="i" tp:name="keycode">
	  <tp:docstring>
      If nonzero, the numeric, system-dependent value corresponding to a

      and may depend on the user's hardware and operating environment.  They therefore are
      rarely useful 'as-is' to AT clients, unless the client has used operating system
      services to identify the hardward keycode associated with a particular key symbol.
      Notifications for key events requested by keycode are less dependent on modifier state
      than <code>keysym</code> based notifications, but some hardware (notably many laptops) may generate
      more than one keycode for the same physical key, depending on the state of physical 
      shift/modifier keys.

	  <tp:docstring>
      If nonzero, the numeric value corresponding to the X Keysym of the key for which 
      notification is requested.  Note that the presence of active modifiers will affect
      whether notification for key events requested via 'keysym' specification takes place, 
      since the keysym depends on the modifier state for most keys.
