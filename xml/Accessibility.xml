 !\mainpage AT-SPI Interfaces and Subinterfaces

  This is the main documentation page for the 
  Assistive Technology Service Provider Interface (AT-SPI). 
  
  \section apps Applications and Interface Components
  Namespace Accessibility includes service APIs implemented by
  participating applications and their user interface components:\n\n
  Accessibility::Accessible\n 
  Accessibility::Application\n
  Accessibility::Desktop\n
  Accessibility::Component\n
  Accessibility::Hypertext\n
  Accessibility::Image\n
  Accessibility::Selection\n
  Accessibility::StreamableContent\n
  Accessibility::Table\n
  Accessibility::Text\n
  Accessibility::EditableText\n
  Accessibility::Value
 
  \section types Enumerated Types
  Accessibility defines a number of key enumerated types, including:\n\n
  Accessibility::RelationType\n
  Accessibility::Role\n
  Accessibility::StateType\n
  Accessibility::Event\n
  Accessibility::EventDetails \n
 
  \section Registry
  Accessibility also includes Accessibility::Registry,
  which is the service used by assistive technologies and related
  AT-SPI clients to register interest in certain classes of events,
  enumerate the currently available desktop and application list,
  and to synthesize certain kinds of device events.
 
  \section listeners Event Listener Interfaces
  Accessibility::EventListener\n
  Accessibility::DeviceEventListener
 
  \section helpers Helper Interfaces
 
  The following interfaces may be implemented by assistive technologies 
  themselves, in order to export their services in a consistent manner or
  in order to interoperate with other applications or desktop services.\n
 
  Accessibility::LoginHelper : Implemented by adaptive technologies which 
  need to participate in user-authentication or login activities, and which
  therefore may need negotiation with authentication agents or processes.\n
 
  Accessibility::Selector [NEW]: Implemented by user agents or assistive 
  technologies which export lists of choices from which the end-user is 
  expected to make selections.  Useful for various types of remote
  activation or intercommunication between multiple ATs.
