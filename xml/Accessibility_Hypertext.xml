<interface name="org.freedesktop.atspi.Hypertext">
  <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <p>An interface used for objects which implement linking between
      multiple resource or content locations, or multiple 'markers'
      within a single document.  A Hypertext instance is associated with
      one or more Hyperlinks, which are associated with particular
      offsets within the Hypertext's included content.  </p>

    <p>@note While this interface is derived from ::Text, 
      there is no requirement that Hypertext instances have
      textual content; they may implement ::Image as well,
      and Hyperlinks need not have non-zero text offsets.</p>
