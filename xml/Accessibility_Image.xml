<interface name="org.freedesktop.accessibility.Image">
  <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <p>An interface implemented by objects which render image data or 
      pictorial information to the screen.  When onscreen components include
      graphical information that is not purely intended to enhance &quot;3d effect&quot;
      or visual layout, but which conveys some semantic or informational 
      content to the sighted user, they should implement Image, and that 
      semantic content should be conveyed textually to the extent possible 
      via the image description, as well as the Accessible::name and 
      Accessible::description properties.  </p>
  </tp:docstring>
  <tp:property name="imageDescription" type="s" access="read">
  <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <p>A UTF-8 string providing a textual description
      of what is visually depicted in the image.  </p>

    <p>@note It is recommended that imageDescription be the shorter
      of the available image descriptions, for instance &quot;alt text&quot;
      in HTML images, and a longer description be provided in
      Accessible::accessible-description, if available.
      A short, one or two word label for the image should be provided in
      Accessible::accessible-name.</p>
