    <p>An interface through which a user-actionable user interface
      component can be manipulated.  Components which react to mouse or
      keyboard input from the user, (with the exception of pure text entry
      fields with no other function), should implement this interface.
      Typical actions include &quot;click&quot;, &quot;press&quot;, &quot;release&quot; (for instance for
      buttons), &quot;menu&quot; (for objects which have context menus invokable from 
      mouse or keyboard), &quot;open&quot; for icons representing files folders, and others.</p>
