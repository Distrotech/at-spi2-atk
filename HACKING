Contributing to AT-SPI:

AT-SPI is a complex package, with lots of dependencies.  We
(maintainers) are not experts in every area; we welcome contributions
and corrections.  However we do ask that all changes to AT-SPI go
through the normal patch approval process (i.e. diff -u).
Please post patches to gnome-accessibility-devel@gnome.org; if in 
doubt you may wish to email questions ahead of time. 

The current maintainers are Bill Haneman (bill.haneman@sun.com) 
and Marc Mulcahy (marc.mulcahy@sun.com).  As a general rule,
Non-trivial maintainer-submitted patches should be posted to 
gnome-accessibility-devel for comment and informational purposes 
prior to commit.

"Build Sheriff" patches are welcome and are exempt from the
normal approval process, provided:

(a) care is taken that the Solaris build does not regress,
as at-spi is a cross-platform package;
(b) the build patches are, generally speaking, not controversial.

At any rate we appreciate being told where we've screwed up, so
let us know if you encounter a significant issue.

Other contributions to AT-SPI are welcome, though we expect
that most accessibility contributions will be to other modules.

-Bill
