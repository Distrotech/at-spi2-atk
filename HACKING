Contributing to AT-SPI:

Bill Haneman (bill.haneman@sun.com)

AT-SPI is a complex package, with lots of dependencies.  We
(maintainers) are not experts in every area; we welcome contributions
and corrections.  However we do ask that all changes to AT-SPI go
through the normal patch approval process (i.e. diff -u).
Please post patches to gnome-accessibility-devel@gnome.org; if in 
doubt you may wish to email maintainers ahead of time.

The current maintainers are myself and Marc Mulcahy 
(marc.mulcahy@sun.com). 

"Build Sheriff" patches are welcome and are exempt from the
normal approval process, provided:

(a) it can be confirmed that the Solaris build does not regress,
as many of our users are based on Solaris and SPARC;
(b) the build patches are, generally speaking, not controversial.

At any rate we appreciate being told where we've screwed up, so
let us know if you encounter a significant issue.

Other contributions to AT-SPI are welcome, though we expect
that most accessibility contributions will be to other modules.

-Bill
