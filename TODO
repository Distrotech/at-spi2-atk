TODO:

idl: 
	+ possibly change Value.idl interface to return a value union. [Bill]
	+ audit IDL for conformance with bonobo/doc/FAQ's [Java]
	naming practice [Michael]
        + possibly change Value.idl interface to return a value
	union. [Bill] *DONE*

cspi: 
	+ API change required if above IDL change is made. [Bill]
	+ move bonobo bits into cspi/bonobo
	+ ensure spi-listener-impl's list notification methods don't
	  have a re-enterancy hazard.
	+ namespace all methods missing a prepending Acessible
	  or SPI_ prefix.
	+ Put LGPL headers everywhere.

registry:
	+ move code into here from libspi
	+ kill the getDeviceWhatnot - and use queryInterface,
	  don't inherit from the Listener interface - use aggregation
	+ fire an event on dead application & re-factor the listen for
	  broken code.

bridge:
	+ move code into here from libspi

libspi: 
	+ remove redundant casts throughout
	+ determine if there are other headers we don't need to install
	+ consider moving the non-impl. parts into registryd/ bridge/ etc.
	+ change the weird string-hash event matching to something sane,
	using GQuark. [Bill]
	+ merge the DeviceEvent and KeyEvent structs to avoid the
	bogus casting of these back and forth.
	+ complete implementation of support for RelationSet and
	StateSet, and export to cspi.
	+ complete and test the pre-emptive key API so that we don't
	always do AnyKey grabs. [Bill]

test:
	+ update test-simple to do complete API tests
	+ Add tests for AtkTable, and add table elements to the test window.
	+ remove comment from test_value; ensure that it works.
