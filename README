D-Bus AT-SPI
------------

This version of at-spi is a major break from previous versions.
It has been completely rewritten to use D-Bus rather than
ORBIT / CORBA for its transport protocol.

A page including instructions for testing, project status and
TODO items is kept up to date at:

The mailing list used for general questions is:

        accessibility-atspi@lists.linux-foundation.org

For bug reports, feature requests, patches or enhancements please use
bugzilla. The freedesktop project name is at-spi2.

More information
----------------

The project was started with a D-Bus performance review
the results of which are available on the GNOME wiki. Keep in
mind that the D-Bus AT-SPI design documents on this page
have not been kept up to date.

Contents of this package
------------------------

This package includes the protocol definitions for the new D-Bus
at-spi, a gtk-module that bridges ATK to the new D-Bus based AT-SPI
as well as 'C' and Python client libraries.

Also included is the daemon neccessary for forwarding device events
and registering accessible applicaitons.



Directory structure
-------------------

The directories within this package are arranged as follows:

    idl

        This directory contains the interface definitions
        (in Interface Definition Language) for the
        accessibility support interfaces exposed by
        the AT central registry, accessible applications,
        and UI components.

        This is possibly historic. The idl formed the basis
        for the XML protocol definitions now located
        in the directory "xml".

    xml 

        This directory contains XML documents describing
        the D-Bus protocol in a subset of Telepathy XML.

    tools

        Miscellaneous tools. Mostly for converting protocol
        XML into D-Bus introspection, 'C' types and documentation.

    droute

        Contains a framework for registering objects
        with a D-Bus connection and for routing messages to
        the implementing object.

        Used by the ATK adaptor.

    dbind

        Library to ease making D-Bus method calls, contains
        marshalling code to convert function arguments
        and a provided D-Bus signature into a D-Bus message.

        Used by cspi.

    spi-common

        Contains 'C' types derived from the D-Bus
        protocol specification. These types are used by 
        both the registry daemon and the ATK adaptor.
        Structures are mainly related to events.

    registryd

        This directory contains code specific to the
        central accessibility registry, and the registry
        executable is built in this directory.

    atk-adaptor

        This directory contains code that bridges 
        the at-spi to the GTK+ toolkit, and which is
        loaded at runtime by GTK+-based Gnome applications.
        The 'bridge' automatically registers GTK+-2.0
        applications with the accessibility registry, 
        and relays UI events from application to registry.
        It is also responsible for servicing requests from
        the registry to register handlers for specific event
        types.

    cspi

        The client (AT) side interface - 'C' bindings.

    registryd

        The registry daemon code. The registry daemon
        keeps a register of accessible applications and presents
        this to clients (ATs).
        It is also responsible for delivering device events.
