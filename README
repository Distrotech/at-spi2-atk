at-spi version 1.9.0

This version of at-spi requires atk 1.17.0 or later.

This version of at-spi is a MAJOR break from previous versions.
It has been completely rewritten to use D-Bus rather than
ORBIT / CORBA for its transport protocol.

Contents of this package ==================================

The directories within this package are arranged as follows:

    idl : This directory contains the interface definitions
	(in Interface Definition Language) for the
	accessibility support interfaces exposed by
	the AT central registry, accessible applications,
	and UI components.
	This is possibly historic. The idl formed the basis
	for the XML protocol definitions now located
	in the directory "xml".

    registryd : This directory contains code specific to the
	central accessibility registry, and the registry
	executable is built in this directory.

    atk-adaptor : This directory contains code that bridges 
	the at-spi to the GTK+ toolkit, and which is
	loaded at runtime by GTK+-based Gnome applications.
	The 'bridge' automatically registers GTK+-2.0
	applications with the accessibility registry, 
	and relays UI events from application to registry.
	It is also responsible for servicing requests from
	the registry to register handlers for specific event
	types.
