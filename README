at-spi version 1.9.0

This version of at-spi requires atk 1.17.0 or later.

This version of at-spi is a MAJOR break from previous versions.
It has been completely rewritten to use D-Bus rather than
ORBIT / CORBA for its transport protocol.

If you have not already done so, please visit

for background information on accessibility, the Gnome 
Accessibility Project, mailing list info, and project status.

Contents of this package ==================================

The directories within this package are arranged as follows:

    idl : This directory contains the interface definitions
	(in Interface Definition Language) for the
	accessibility support interfaces exposed by
	the AT central registry, accessible applications,
	and UI components.

	This is possibly historic. The idl formed the basis
	for the XML protocol definitions now located
	in the directory "xml".

    xml : This directory contains XML documents describing
	the D-Bus protocol in a subset of Telepathy XML.

    tools : Miscellaneous tools. Mostly for converting protocol
	XML into D-Bus introspection, 'C' types and documentation.

    droute : Contains a framework for registering objects
	with a D-Bus connection and for routing messages to
	the implementing object.

	Used by the ATK adaptor.

    dbind : Library to ease making D-Bus method calls, contains
	marshalling code to convert function arguments
	and a provided D-Bus signature into a D-Bus message.
	
	Used by cspi.

    spi-common : Contains 'C' types derived from the D-Bus
	protocol specification. These types are used by 
	both the registry daemon and the ATK adaptor.
	Structures are mainly related to events.

    registryd : This directory contains code specific to the
	central accessibility registry, and the registry
	executable is built in this directory.

    atk-adaptor : This directory contains code that bridges 
	the at-spi to the GTK+ toolkit, and which is
	loaded at runtime by GTK+-based Gnome applications.
	The 'bridge' automatically registers GTK+-2.0
	applications with the accessibility registry, 
	and relays UI events from application to registry.
	It is also responsible for servicing requests from
	the registry to register handlers for specific event
	types.

    cspi : The client (AT) side interface - 'C' bindings.

    registryd : The registry daemon code. The registry daemon
	keeps a register of accessible applications and presents
	this to clients (ATs).
	It is also responsible for delivering device events.
