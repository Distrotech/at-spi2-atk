* added boolean return for
Accessibility_Registry_registerKeystrokeListener.
* Revved activation ID for registry to "1.0"
* many bugfixes and improvements to global key listener implementation.
* improvements to regression test "test-simple", added key

screen-review can be implemented with at-spi.

What's new in at-spi-0.13.1:

(note: 0.13.1 is not binary compatible with 0.12.1, clients will need
 to recompile )

* fix for bugzilla bug 80616
* IDL change which will affect direct CORBA users of the keystroke
  listener API
* added a new test harness, event-listener-test, which also
  has a simple tree traversal timing benchmark. event-listener-test
  attaches listeners to all currently supported events (and a few
  events which are not fully implemented yet); it thus serves
  as useful event listener sample code as well as being a diagnostic
  tool. 

What's new in at-spi-0.12.1:

  magnifier and mag_control client.
* Badly broken AccessibleStateSet implementation fixed by
  Marc.
* Added implementation for AccessibleComponent_grabFocus method.
* Improvements to documentation.

API CHANGES:

* Added missing seek_type param in
  AccessibleStreamableContent_seek [78888], 
  previously documented but not in signature;
  this was unused API but needed fixing for the future.

* Added API for AccessibleTable_selectRow and _selectColumn,
  corresponding to similar API in ATK, and provided
  implementation. [76201]

* Added boolean return types to a number of IDL methods whose
  corresponding cspi wrappers and ATK methods already had boolean
  returns.

* Made Accessibility_StateSet inherit from BonoboUnknown as it should;
this was the main existing breakage in StateSet.


=================


TODO API Additions:

getStateName () and STATE_EXTENDED to allow extension of State API (already 
in ATK).

AccessibleAction_getType () and AccessibleAction_getTypeName ().

need getBaseAttributes () 
for AccessibleText (available in ATK I think).

table: getVisibleRange

state: HEADER, etc. for spreadsheet cells
