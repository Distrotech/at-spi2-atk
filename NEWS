  defines them.

* Use libatspi to get the accessibility bus and handle main loop integration.
  This fixes a crash with some builds of Firefox (FDO#35115).
  Note that this adds a dependency on libatspi.

* Fix accessibility of applications running as root on Linux.

former variable as well for now.
